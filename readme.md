# Calorie Tracker App

# Description
This is a web based application that uses API Routes that allow a user to create an account and track their calories by meal. All the user input is stored in the backend in a Mysql database using sequelize. The user can create an account if they do not have one, login once they create one and enter their information for whichever meal they chose. The user will be able to add a food item and its respective calories and also delete the name of the food or their calories. In other words the user will be allowed to edit past inputs and will be able to make changes to the database.
